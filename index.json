We thus reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture demonstrating an ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial process. Building on the previous competitions, _Traffic4cast_ 2021 now focuses on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly, this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static road graph as input.","tags":null,"title":"Traffic4cast at NeurIPS 2021 – Temporal and Spatial Few-Shot Transfer Learning in Gridded Geo-Spatial Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jay Santokhi","Yiming Yang","Dylan Hillier","et al."],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1635292800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635292800,"objectID":"557dc08fd4b672a0c08e0a8cf0c9ff7d","permalink":"https://yyimingucl.github.io/publication/preprint/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/","section":"publication","summary":"The landscape of city-wide mobility behaviour has altered significantly over the past 18 months. The ability to make accurate and reliable predictions on such behaviour has likewise changed drastically with COVID-19 measures impacting how populations across the world interact with the different facets of mobility. This raises the question - _\"How does one use an abundance of pre-covid mobility data to make predictions on future behaviour in a present/post-covid environment?\"_ This paper seeks to address this question by introducing an approach for traffic frame prediction using a lightweight Dual-Encoding U-Net built using only 12 Convolutional layers that incorporates a novel approach to skip-connections between Convolutional LSTM layers.This approach combined with an intuitive handling of training data can model both a temporal and spatio-temporal domain shift.","tags":null,"title":"Dual Encoding U-Net for Spatio-Temporal Domain Shift Frame Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiming Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"Overview In regression problem, we are actually looking for a function that maps input $x$ to output $y$ . There are commonly two approaches: 1. We restrict the function space/form (linear, quadratic,...) and optimize their weights to approximate the true function. The problem with this approach is that we need to decide what kind of functions to use, and if the chosen type of function does not naturally match the underlying function, we can never obatin a well-apprxoimated function by only adjusting the weights. 2. The second considers arbitrary functions and chooses the one that fits the given sample $(X, Y)$ more closely (greater likelihood). The problem with this method is that it needs to consider an infinite number of functions, but this is not possible and thus requires the use of the Gaussian process in the title. Firstly, I will give the definition of [Gaussian Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) from wikipedia: A Gaussian process is a stochastic process (a collection of random variables indexed by time or space) such that every finite collection of those random variables forms a multivariate normal distribution. Remark: **Every finite collection of those random variables forms a multivariate normal distribution**. This property will be our panacea for any upcoming troubles! correlation ### 1. Two-dimensional Gaussian distribution From the above definition, it is clear that any number of random variables form a Gaussian distribution. To simplify the problem, we firstly take two of these random variables such that $(x_1,x_2)\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ . Three pictures below: (left) Density contours of the distribution. (right) Sampled values of the random variables $x_1,x_2$ . ![png](2d_gaussian_cov0.png) *cov(x1,x2)=0* ![png](2d_gaussian_cov0.7.png) *cov(x1,x2)=0.7* ![png](2d_gaussian_cov0.95.png) *cov(x1,x2)=0.95* As you can see from the graph above, as the correlation between $x_1,x_2$ gets larger, the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ that we sample become more and more similar. (As can be expected, when the correlation is close to 1, no matter how many times we sample, $x_1$ is always equal to $x_2$ . ### 2. High-dimensional Gaussian distribution The simple two-dimensional case was studied, let\u0026#39;s now extend to 20 dimensions. ![png](finite_sample_demo.png) *20-dimensional Gaussian distribution* The two left figures above, same as in 2D case, are sampled values for $(x_1,x_2,...x_{20})$ $ obtained from a 20-dimensional Gaussian distribution (Do the shown curves look like the non-linear regressions?) The right panel shows the covariance matrix, where you can see that variables has a strong correlation with their neighbors (also reflected in the two panes on the left, where the adjacent variables do not vary largely, thus making the whole curve very smooth.)
