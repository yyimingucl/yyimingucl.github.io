abstract: The IARAI _Traffic4cast_ competitions at NeurIPS 2019 and 2020 showed that neural networks can successfully predict future traffic conditions 1 hour into the future on simply aggregated GPS probe data in time and space bins. We thus reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial process. Building on the previous competitions, _Traffic4cast_ 2021 now focuses on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space. Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics
sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly, this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static road graph as input.

abstract: The landscape of city-wide mobility behaviour has altered significantly over the
past 18 months. The ability to make accurate and reliable predictions on such
behaviour has likewise changed drastically with COVID-19 measures impacting
how populations across the world interact with the different facets of mobility. This
raises the question - "How does one use an abundance of pre-covid mobility data
to make predictions on future behaviour in a present/post-covid environment?"
This paper seeks to address this question by introducing an approach for traffic
frame prediction using a lightweight Dual-Encoding U-Net built using only 12
Convolutional layers that incorporates a novel approach to skip-connections between Convolutional LSTM layers. This approach combined with an intuitive handling of training data can model both a temporal and spatio-temporal domain
shift.
