abstract: The landscape of city-wide mobility behaviour has altered significantly over the past 18 months. The ability to make accurate and reliable predictions on such behaviour has likewise changed drastically with COVID-19 measures impacting how populations across the world interact with the different facets of mobility. This raises the question - _"How does one use an abundance of pre-covid mobility data to make predictions on future behaviour in a present/post-covid environment?"_ This paper seeks to address this question by introducing an approach for traffic frame prediction using a lightweight Dual-Encoding U-Net built using only 12 Convolutional layers that incorporates a novel approach to skip-connections between Convolutional LSTM layers.This approach combined with an intuitive handling of training data can model both a temporal and spatio-temporal domain shift.

abstract: The landscape of city-wide mobility behaviour has altered significantly over the
past 18 months. The ability to make accurate and reliable predictions on such
behaviour has likewise changed drastically with COVID-19 measures impacting
how populations across the world interact with the different facets of mobility. This
raises the question - "How does one use an abundance of pre-covid mobility data
to make predictions on future behaviour in a present/post-covid environment?"
This paper seeks to address this question by introducing an approach for traffic
frame prediction using a lightweight Dual-Encoding U-Net built using only 12
Convolutional layers that incorporates a novel approach to skip-connections between Convolutional LSTM layers. This approach combined with an intuitive handling of training data can model both a temporal and spatio-temporal domain
shift.
