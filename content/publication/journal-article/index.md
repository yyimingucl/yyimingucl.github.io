abstract: The IARAI _Traffic4cast_ competitions at NeurIPS 2019 and 2020 showed that neural networks
can successfully predict future traffic conditions 1 hour into the future on simply aggregated
GPS probe data in time and space bins. We thus reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting
traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture,
demonstrating an ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial
process. Building on the previous competitions, _Traffic4cast_ 2021 now focuses on the
question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space. Moving from one
city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID
hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data
featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing
data compiled from over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics
sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly, this seemed to
require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static road graph as input.
