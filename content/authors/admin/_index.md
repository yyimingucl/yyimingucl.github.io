Hi there, welcome to my personal website. My name is Yiming Yang. I am a first-year PhD student in Statistical Science and Advanced Computing at [Department of Statistical Science, University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), where I am luckly supervised by [Prof. Serge Guillas](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/sergeguillas). Prior to my current role, I completed my Master program MSc Computational Statiscs and Machine Learning from the Department of Computer Science, UCL. I obtained Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statiscs at the Department of Mathematics, UCL. My research is mainly funded by [United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/) and UCL jointly.

My research mainly aims at developing new methods to quantify uncertainties in exascale (1 exaFLOP is 10^18 floating point operation per second) simulation models by Statistical Methods and Machine Learning. In partcular, I am working on the Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) of exascale nuclear fusion simulation which is involved in two projects: [SEAVEA (Software Environment for Actionable & VVUQ-evaluated Exascale Applications) ](https://www.seavea-project.org/)and AQUIFER (Advanced Quantification of Uncertainties In Fusion modelling at the Exascale with model order Reducation).

<!-- My main research topic is uncertainty quantification for exscale tokamak nuclear simulation, which covers many areas like sensivity analysis, stochastic modelling, computational fluid dynamics, and etc. Currently, I focus on the surrogate modelling for some exscale simulation codes for tokamak nuclear fusion including gaussian process, polynomial regression, and neural networks. Apart from my PhD research, I am also interested in general machine learning tasks, like computer vision and reinforcement learning. -->
