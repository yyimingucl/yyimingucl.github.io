Hi there, welcome to my personal website. My name is Yiming Yang. I am a first-year PhD student in Statistical Science and Advanced Computing at [Department of Statistical Science, University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Serge Guillas](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/sergeguillas). Prior to my current role, I completed my Master program MSc Computational Statiscs and Machine Learning from the Department of Computer Science, UCL. I obtained Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statiscs at the Department of Mathematics, UCL. 

My research mainly aims at developing new methods to quantify uncertainties in exascale (1 exaFLOP is 10^18 floating point operation per second) simulation models by Statistical Methods and Machine Learning. In partcular, I am working on the Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) of exascale nuclear fusion simulation which is involved in two projects: [SEAVEA (Software Environment for Actionable & VVUQ-evaluated Exascale Applications) ](https://www.seavea-project.org/)and AQUIFER (Advanced Quantification of Uncertainties In Fusion modelling at the Exascale with model order Reducation).

Currently, I am researching the methodolgies and applications of Linked Gaussian Process (GP) for emulating large-scale coupled physcial simulation with high-dimensional intermediate variables. The emulation will siginificately accelerate the discovery of physcial domain which help better understand the underlying principles and play an important role in the downstream statistical tasks (UQ, Sensitivity Analysis, and so on).

My main research topic is uncertainty quantification for exscale tokamak nuclear simulation, which covers many areas like sensivity analysis, stochastic modelling, computational fluid dynamics, and etc. Currently, I focus on the surrogate modelling for some exscale simulation codes for tokamak nuclear fusion including gaussian process, polynomial regression, and neural networks. Apart from my PhD research, I am also interested in general machine learning tasks, like computer vision and reinforcement learning.
